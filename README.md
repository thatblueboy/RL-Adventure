## Algorithms Implemented

1. [**Dynamic Programming (DP):**](dynamic_programming/)
   <!-- - Description: DP applied using a determinstic policy to FrozenLake. -->

2. [**Monte Carlo (MC):**](monte_carlo/)
   <!-- - Description: MC applied using a determinstic policy to FrozenLake. -->

3. [**Temporal Difference (TD):**](temporal_difference/)
   <!-- - Description: TD applied using a determinstic policy to FrozenLake. -->

4. [**Policy Gradients (PG):**](policy_gradients/)
   <!-- - Description: PG applied using a determinstic policy to FrozenLake. -->

## Repository Structure

- Each algorithm has its dedicated folder (`dynamic_programming/`, `monte_carlo/`, `temporal_difference/`, `policy_gradients/`) containing code and related documentation.
- Each folder contains `src/` for the source code, `/notebooks` for testing the code and for documentation. `/notebooks` is under construction. Temporarily the files in `src/` can be ran directly to train and test the algorithms.
- `_environments/` contains a modified verion of farama-foundations's FrozenLake environment that allows for modifying the reward structure.
- The code is designed to be readable and well-documented to aid in understanding and learning.
